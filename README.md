# poeCam
PoE Camera setup for Raspberry Pi. HTML page timestamped.
Timestamp script is evaluated client side so the timestamp is currently irrelevant. 
Need to move this to be firstly generated on the Pi itself when I get round to it!
Taken from:
https://picamera.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.13/recipes1.html
I'll eventually sort out this repository, it is rather poorly done so far...
